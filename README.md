# Hello, there!

## I am Brandon! Welcome to my GitHub!

Here I have some projects I have made as a display of my capacity to understand and learn about coding, data, or any projects that seem relevant to control on Git! 
I typically use python, SQL, and excel in my daily life but I am looking forward to becoming for adept at using tools like R, c#, java, rust, or any other language that seems interesting or can solve a particular problem.  

Working currently as a testing engineer, I use data in real life and for fun to better underdstand topics, create insight, and bring value to myself and the stakeholders who rely on me!

Git and GitHub is new to me. I am open to discussion and would like to become a more active part of the community!
