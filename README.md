# Hello, there!

## I am Brandon! Welcome to my GitHub!

Here I have some projects I have made as a display of my capacity to understand and learn about coding, data, and cybersecurity. 

I am mainly a manager and leader, however my goal is to break into more technical work. So, I am increasing my chops!
